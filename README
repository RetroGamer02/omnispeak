Omnispeak: An reimplementation of "Commander Keen in Goodbye Galaxy!"

Omnispeak is an open-source reimplementation of Commander Keen episodes 4, 5,
and 6. It aims to be a pixel-perfect, bug-for-bug clone of the original games,
and is compatible with savegames from the DOS version.

Omnispeak's homepage, including binary downloads, is available at:
	https://davidgow.net/keen/omnispeak.html

Omnispeak's source code can be found on GitHub:
	https://github.com/sulix/omnispeak

== INSTALLATION ==
To play, you'll need to include files from the original game.

Omnispeak 3DS supports:
	- Keen 4 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 5 v1.4 EGA
	- Keen 6 v1.4 EGA

These should be the easiest versions to get. For example, the Steam version and
the GOG.com version are both version 1.4, as are all the previous downloadable
versions from both id Software and 3D Realms / Apogee. Keen 6 is not easily
available, but you should be able to find patches which convert one version of
the game to another. Keen 6 v1.5 fixes a few bugs, so it's probably best to use
it if you can. Note that the game will likely crash if you use any other version,
including the CGA versions and the v1.0 releases, as well as the retail FormGen /
GT Interative versions and the Keen 6 version bundled with the id Anthology.

The shareware release of Keen 4 v1.4 EGA is available here:
	https://davidgow.net/keen/4keen14.zip


You'll need to take the following files from your version of Keen, and place
them in the '3ds/omnispeak' directory:
	* GAMEMAPS.CK?
	* EGAGRAPH.CK?
	* AUDIO.CK?

You'll also need the files from the 'data' directory corresponding to your
version of Keen.

== CONFIGURATION ==

Omnispeak can read settings from the 'OMNISPK.CFG' file in the "user path".
This is a simple key/value file which looks something like this:

--8<--
# Graphics settings
fullscreen = true

# The OPL emulator used by the SDL audio backend
# Valid values: "dbopl" (DOSBox), "nukedopl3" (NukedOPL3)
oplEmulator = "dbopl"
--8<--

Modifying settings from the ComputerWrist interface will update this config
file with the new settings.

Note that this file is not episode-specific. The settings are shared between
all episodes.

== COMPILING ==

You'll find it in the src/ directory and built with make.

Omnispeak should build fine on most Linux distributions.

== NEW FEATURES ==

Omnispeak includes a new QuickLoad / QuickSave feature, which allows the game
in the final save slot to be saved and loaded without needing to navigate
the menu. This is done with the F5 and F9 keys by default: they can be changed
in the Keyboard bindings menu.

Omnispeak also greatly expands Joystick configuration over the
original DOS games. Additional keys / buttons can be re-bound, and a 'modern'
mode for the joystick is often easier to use, particularly when moving
diagonally.

That's all!  Now go play Commander Keen!
